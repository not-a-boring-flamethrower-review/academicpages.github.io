Beyond the burn: Studies on the
physiological effects of flamethrowers
during World War II
David W. Van Wyck
Abstract
Flamethrowers are widely considered one of warfare’s most controversial weapons and are capable of inflicting
gruesome physical injuries and intense psychological trauma. Despite being the last of the major combatants in
World War II (WWII) to develop them, the United States military quickly became the most frequent and adept
operator of portable flamethrowers. This gave the U.S. military ample opportunity to observe the effects of
flamethrowers on enemy soldiers. However, while most people in modern times would consider immolation by
flamethrower to be an unnecessarily painful and inhumane way to inflict casualties, immolation was, at one point
during World War II (WWII), referred to as “mercy killing” by the U.S. Chemical Warfare Service (CWS). This
mischaracterization arose from a series of first-hand accounts describing what were believed to be quick, painless,
and unmarred deaths, as well as from a poor and incomplete understanding of flamethrower lethality. As a result,
indirect mechanisms such as hypoxia and carbon monoxide poisoning were generally absent from accounts of the
flamethrower’s fatal effects. It was not until several years after flamethrowers were introduced to the frontlines that
the CWS and National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) conducted a series of tests to better understand the
physiological and toxicological effects of flamethrowers. This article examines how the initial absence of scientific
data on the physiologic effects of flamethrowers led to an inaccurate understanding of their lethality, and bizarre
claims that one of history’s most horrific instruments of war was considered one of the more “humane” weapons
on the battlefield.

Background
Despite the widespread development, manufacturing,
and use of flamethrowers by the U.S. military in the Pacific theater during World War II (WWII), there was
surprisingly little effort directed at determining details
on the lethality, physiological and toxicological effects of
these weapons. Although flamethrowers grew in popularity in the Pacific, where they were employed against
enemy soldiers known to take up strongly fortified and
entrenched positions, there seemed to be a lack of scientific interest in studying the weapon, with one Chemical
Warfare Bulletin article from 1944 stating, “It was felt
that so long as the flamethrower produced death to the
enemy, the precise physiological reaction or how soon
death supervened were immaterial [1].” However, with
the increased use of the flamethrower in the Pacific theater, there came a growing interest in developing better
tactics to maximize the potential of the weapon. This
required, in part, a better understanding of how the
flamethrower produced casualties. Moreover, increased
utilization meant increased publicity, and the nature of a
flame weapon caused controversy. Newspapers increasingly referred to flamethrowers as barbarous, inhumane
weapons of horror, and the Japanese were described as
being terrified of the weapon, with some accounts
reporting Japanese soldiers taking their own lives when
faced with an imminent flamethrower attack [2]. Contrasting portrayals were published by the U.S. military
that included first-hand accounts from U.S. chemical
soldiers and officers citing not only the effectiveness of
the flamethrower on fortified enemy positions but also
observations that the weapons seemingly produced

instantaneous deaths, even in situations where there was
little or no evidence of thermal injury on enemy corpses.
Some went so far as to claim that flamethrowers were
“mercy killers,” particularly when compared to bullets
and high explosives [3]. All these considerations
prompted the Chemical Warfare Service (CWS), the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), the Medical Corps, and a host of other private companies and
universities to conduct experiments on the toxicology
and physiology of flamethrower attacks that better
assessed the military utility and killing power of this terrifying weapon. These studies helped end the notion of
flamethrowers as mercy weapons and provided physiologic and toxicologic data on burns, heat exposure
thresholds, asphyxiation, inhalational injury from smoke
and chemical irritants, and carbon monoxide and dioxide poisoning that remain useful in contemporary military medicine.
Overview of portable flamethrowers
While the use of fire in warfare has existed since approximately 424 BC when the Greeks created the first
flamethrower, it was not until World War I (WWI) that
flame warfare was adapted for use by soldiers in a portable fashion. The Germans developed the first manportable flamethrowers and flame warfare tactics, and
other nations soon followed suit. As the conflict progressed from static to mobile combat in the final year of
the war, there were fewer opportunities to effectively use
the flamethrower. Because the U.S. did not enter the war
until 1918, the country gained little experience with
flamethrowers and unsurprisingly failed to study or develop flamethrowers of its own during the interwar
years. It was not until July of 1940, after the U.S. military
became aware of the use of flamethrowers in Europe
during the early part of WWII, that the Secretary of
War ordered the CWS to develop a flamethrower. Interestingly, while the U.S. was the farthest behind of all
major combatants in the development of flamethrowers
and arguably produced the most onerous flamethrower
of the war, the M1 portable flamethrower (Fig. 1), U.S.
soldiers quickly became the most adept users of flamethrowers and relied heavily on their use in the Pacific
theater. In a short period of time, the U.S. would eventually develop what is widely considered to be the best
flamethrower of the war, the M2–2 flamethrower (Fig. 2).
Yet despite the focus on developing an effective flamethrower and flamethrower tactics, the U.S. had a poor
initial understanding of the weapon’s lethality [4]. According to opening statements made at the 1945 “Symposium on the Toxicological Aspects of Flame
Throwers” by Major General William N. Porter, Chief of
the U.S. CWS, “the failure of the nation to support a
strong and active military scientific organization during
the peace time years was a great handicap to us when the
need for rapid preparation for this war became apparent
[5].” After rushing the weapons into development and
onto the battlefield with little to no scientific data, several
first-hand observations began to appear in military reports
that mischaracterized the weapon’s use and effects.
The flamethrower as a “mercy killer”
In 1944, the CWS began to run articles in the Chemical
Warfare Bulletin proposing that flamethrowers caused
instant death with far less pain and suffering than bullets, explosives, and other common battlefield weapons.
Lt. Col. Orbie Bostick, a chemical officer in the South
Pacific and author of a 1944 article entitled Mercy Killer:
Instant Death from the Flame Thrower (Fig. 3),

recounted an interview with Marine Corps flamethrower
operators who had used the weapon to neutralize a Japanese pillbox during the campaign. Bostick wrote that the
Marines had told him that “less than two min after the
flame thrower bursts entered the gun ports we were
examining the interior. We found five Jap bodies in the
pillbox. Not one showed a spark of life. Those Japs were
knocked out instantly, no question about it.” He then
referenced his own personal experiences witnessing
deaths from flamethrowers and noted that “I can vouch
for the fact that the bodies of flamethrower victims were
scarcely marked by flames; the skin was hardly touched.”
Bostick suggested several mechanisms for what he calls
the “instant-death theory” based on off-the-record
discussions with personnel from the CWS Medical Division, the Surgeon General’s Office, and the Navy Department. He paraphrased their positions in his article
and concluded that systemic shock was the cause of
death: “The physiological effects of flame thrower attacks
are complex. Principally, there is mass stimulation of the
sensory nerve endings. This may also be described as a
‘profound insult’ to the nervous system. There is also intense shock to the respiratory center, paralyzing the
muscles of respiration. It is believed the victim probably
feels no pain.” He further concluded that based on these
suppositions and experiences, the flamethrower is a
“more merciful” weapon that many others, such as high
explosives, since it leads to instantaneous death [6].

Not long after Lt. Col. Bostick published his article,
the Chemical Warfare Bulletin ran another article, CWS
Studies Flame Deaths, which continued to promote the
idea that flamethrower deaths were instantaneous. As
before, the author speculated as to the exact cause of
death: “Profound shock to the nervous system, lack of
oxygen in the blood (anoxemia), carbon monoxide poisoning, superheat generated at the flame front, thirddegree burns and suffocation as the result of searing the
air passages and lungs are the principle theories which
have been advanced.” The article referenced a special report submitted by Captain J.F. Olds, a chemical officer
during the New Georgia campaign who was charged
with investigating whether the enemy died “a slow death
or whether death was instantaneous.” Olds reported that
enemy dead were found in some cases with severe burns
and in other cases without signs of burning, that he had
not seen enemy soldiers leave a fortification alive after a
flamethrower attack and that “the enemy may or may
not give a short cry when he encounters liquid flame
[and] it is believed by all those who have operated flamethrowers or been at the action and who have examined
the results that if such a cry did occur the enemy was
dead by the time he finished the cry.” Ultimately, Olds
concluded that “there is no lingering death when the
flame hits the enemy” and that “we definitely know that
death comes instantly [and] whether it be by high
temperature or burning, the enemy dies a humane death
[7].” Despite the absurdity of such a claim through a
modern lens, there was little scientific evidence at the
time to refute it.
Studying the physiological and toxicological effects of
flamethrowers
On March 22, 1944, the Technical Division of the CWS
in Washington D.C. called a meeting to discuss “deficiencies” in the understanding of the casualty-producing
effect of flamethrowers. It was noted that “little or nothing was known regarding the precise manner by which
immediate disability or death is produced incident to
flame thrower action,” and a recommendation was made
that the Physiological Section of the Office of Scientific
Research and Development (OSRD) Division 9 (Chemistry) “undertake an experimental investigation of the relative importance of casualty-producing attributes of flame
thrower attack [8].” The purpose of doing so was to
maximize the offensive use of flamethrowers in combat,
as well as to develop effective defensive measures to protect soldiers against enemy flame attacks [9]. As a result,
the CWS and NDRC organized and funded a series of
investigations throughout 1944 involving multiple agencies, private companies, and universities. In general, the
investigators began with the untested hypotheses that
any single one or combination of the following
mechanisms contributed to rapid fatality from a flamethrower attack: 1) the inhalation of carbon monoxide
(CO), 2) hypoxia, 3) the inhalation of vaporized gasoline
or intermediary combustion products, 4) the inhalation
of superheated air, or 5) the burning of the surface of
the body. Subsequent testing, therefore, was designed
primarily to evaluate these factors [10].
Some of the earliest scientific data regarding the toxicological and physiological effects of flamethrowers
came from testing intended to evaluate other aspects of
portable flame warfare, such as new flamethrower equipment, fuels, and tactics. For example, Arthur D. Little,
Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, under Contract
OEMsr-242, recorded the physiological effects of flame
attacks against occupants within an enclosed structure
while evaluating a new type of flamethrower fuel,
phosphorus-phosphorus sesquisulfide, also known as
EWP, in August 1944. The evaluators built a series of
pillboxes modeled after German designs that included a
reinforced concrete, earth-filled, hexagonal bunker with
internal lengths of 6 ft on each side and a ceiling of 6.5
ft. The total inside volume measured 900 cubic feet, and
the combined ventilation area included a 3.5 × 3.0-ft
door and six 14.5 × 6.5-in. loopholes for a total of 14.5
square feet. A Y-shaped baffle of cinder blocks reached
from the floor to the ceiling, with each baffle leg being
32 in. wide and 3 in. thick and radiating out from the
center of the structure. This effectively divided the structure into three sections known as the “fire” (where the
loopholes to be targeted for attack were located), “off,”
and “door” compartments (Fig. 4). The M2–2 flamethrower was used to deliver a 1-gal flame attack from a
fixed distance with either a 4% gasoline-napalm mixture
or EWP. Small domestic swine with pneumographs,
thermocouples, specialized discs that measured caloric
bombardment, and electrocardiographs attached were
placed into the pillboxes. Temperature and gas compositions were measured continuously within the pillbox
throughout the experiment. In a second experiment,
rabbits and pigs (one of each) were placed in six designated locations within the pillbox to determine which
positions were most affected by 1-gal flame attacks from
a fixed distance. The animals were removed from the
pillboxes at the end of the experiment for autopsy and
microscopic tissue evaluation. With regard to animal
casualties, the investigators noted that thermal injury appeared to be the primary cause of death in the experimental animals, with respiratory conditions determined
to be a contributing factor. Not surprisingly, burns were
worst in the animals placed in the “fire” compartment,
followed by the “off” and then “door” compartments,
with animals in higher positions being more seriously injured than those in lower positions. Respiratory lesions,
on the other hand, did not appear to be related to the
Van Wyck Military Medical Research (2020) 7:8 Page 4 of 8
animals’ position in the bunker and consisted mainly of
atelectasis, pulmonary edema, and pulmonary hemorrhage
[11, 12]. While these early reports demonstrated the
flame’s ability to heat an enclosed space and affect all targets in a bunker, including those not directly in the flame’s
path, further research later provided a more comprehensive understanding of flamethrower lethality.
On January 29–30, 1945, Division 9 of the NDRC organized and hosted the “Symposium on the Toxicological Aspects of the Flame Thrower” at Dumbarton
Oaks in Washington, D.C. as a result of a request from
the Medical Division of the CWS for assistance in evaluating the lethal effects of heat and other toxic factors associated with flame thrower attacks. The Symposium’s
reports consisted of over a year’s worth of data collected
by various research teams that, in summary, showed “the
lethal effects of flame attack when used against enclosed
spaces are not limited to burning, or even to circumambient heat, but include other factors the field importance
of which is not yet fully determined [13].” One of the
major reports on flamethrower casualties came from a
Harvard University team led by Frederick C. Henriques,
PhD and Alan Moritz, MD of Harvard University. A report of their study, “An experimental investigation of the
physiological mechanisms concerned in the production
of casualties by flame thrower attack” was compiled in
August 1944 and presented at the symposium. The report detailed the effects of gasoline conflagration on several animal models. For their study, dogs and pigs were
exposed to burning gas after being anesthetized and
fastened to an iron frame 54 in. above the floor in the
center of a conflagration room. From their experiments,
they noted several key toxicological and physiological
findings. The average temperatures from gasoline conflagration in ventilated and unventilated structures varied between 350°Cand 600 °C, though temperature peaks
as high as 1000 °C were recorded. Direct exposure of the
animal’s body to gas flames resulted in death from the
effects of the heat within 60 s, though indirect exposure
to the flames and the resulting increase in temperature
had a variable effect and seemed related to the animal’s
core temperature recorded by rectal thermometer. Animals that died within 30 min after exposure had systemic
hyperthermia of 43 °C or higher, whereas those that survived had core temperatures measured at 42.5 °C or less.
Additionally, the investigators found that all animals exposed to temperatures greater than 105 °C for more than
3 min, greater than 150 °C for more than 2 min, or
greater than 400 °C for more than 30 s all sustained severe burns and became critical casualties. Physiological
derangements noted in test animals included electrocardiographic changes such as tachycardia, inverted Twaves, a reduction in QRS voltage, and premature ventricular contractions that evolved into ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Blood pressure rose
initially with exposure to heat, but a terminal drop usually occurred in conjunction with respiratory failure. Although potassium levels were elevated following
liberation from the affected red blood cells and were
suspected to be a cause of immediate death, the

Van Wyck Military Medical Research (2020) 7:8 Page 5 of 8
potassium levels never rose to a level that was considered likely to contribute to death in the animals. Despite
this conclusion, the researchers found an overall poor
correlation between cutaneous injury and physiological
changes, with some of the most severe physiological derangements noted in animals with minor or no cutaneous injuries. Ultimately, the investigators concluded that
rapid elevation in circulating blood temperature leading
to the cessation of the cardiac function was likely the
cause of immediate death following exposure to heat.
Shock was also noted to be a major contributing factor
in animals who did not die immediately. Interestingly,
asphyxiation and CO poisoning were believed to be less
likely than heat to cause immediate or rapid fatalities.
The mean concentration of CO in the atmosphere of an
unventilated room after the fires had burned out was
0.8%, and the mean oxygen concentration was 14.6%.
One animal tested had a blood CO level of 30%. Thus,
while CO exposure would likely have killed the animal if
it had remained in the room for a long enough period, it
was not thought to be a major contributor in these test
subjects [14].
One potential criticism of studies such as those by
Henriques and Moritz is that data obtained from animals may not extrapolate well to humans. Even pig skin,
which is considered very similar to human skin from an
anatomical perspective, lacks the human cooling mechanism of sweating. This characteristic could theoretically
result in differences from the animal data, though the
authors noted that a 70-kg male sweating maximally (approximately 1 l of sweat per hour or 1 mg of water per
square centimeter) would require a caloric input of 0.6
cal/minute to evaporate this volume. Because the
amount of caloric input to burn pig skin was between
0.8–45 cal/(g·min), depending on the degree of heat the
animal was exposed to, the protection afforded to
humans via perspiration was thought to be “trivial.” The
pig data on caloric bombardment was therefore considered directly applicable to humans [15].
While Henriques and Moritz reported the effects of
heat exposure on flamethrower casualties, other investigators presented data at the symposium on contributory
factors such as asphyxia, CO poisoning, and hydrocarbon vapors. Contrary to some of the findings in the
Contract OEMsr-242 study by Little, Inc., which downplayed the respiratory effects of flame attacks, these
studies noted several major findings independent of the
thermal injuries. Lieutenant (JG) J. Seronde of the Naval
Reserve Medical Corps reported on several corpses examined after flamethrower attacks during the Battle of
Saipan in which respiratory injury appeared to play a significant role. Specifically, he reported that four civilian
women who had been found hiding in caves with Japanese soldiers were subjected to flamethrower attacks and
had no external burns but appeared to have died as a result of respiratory failure, with postmortem exams showing evidence of inhalational injury caused by irritant
substances derived from flamethrower fuels [16]. This
seemed to complement findings of ventricular fibrillation
in test animals that appeared secondary to hydrocarbon
vapors reported by 1st Lieutenant M.B. Chenoweth from
the Medical Division of the CWS [17]. Cardiac toxicity
from hydrocarbon exposure has since become a welldocumented consequence of recreational use of hydrocarbon substances such as “huffing” which involves
breathing a rag soaked with a hydrocarbon inhalant such
as kerosene, gas or naphtha [18]. Further, some investigators reported a rapid and sudden increase in lethal CO
levels detected within the bunkers, as well as dangerously low oxygen content. These reports noted that
when carboxyhemoglobin levels in the blood reached
70%, the result was unconsciousness and usually death
and that CO could reach lethal levels in poorly ventilated structures within 2 min. Furthermore, as little as
0.1% CO in breathable air was sufficient to maintain lethal blood levels of CO, and such levels could be remain
for 7–10 min after a flame attack before beginning to decrease. At the same time, oxygen was completely depleted for up to 15 s, a more than adequate time for
instantaneous unconsciousness to result [19–21]. These
studies suggested that respiratory factors were a significant contributing cause of death for those in an enclosed
space under flame attack. The findings are generally
consistent with what is reported in contemporary medical literature, i.e., that carboxyhemoglobin levels higher
than 60% are generally fatal [22]. Furthermore, these
studies brought attention to the effects of inhaling superheated air and smoke. Current data have shown that
temperatures within an enclosed burning structure can
reach 540–1150 °C. Breathing air at these temperatures
results in burns of the oropharynx, leading to progressive upper airway edema and, ultimately, asphyxia. This
is worsened by the water-soluble toxins present in
smoke that precipitate in the trachea and further degrade pulmonary function by causing chemical tracheitis
and/or pneumonitis [23, 24]. These inhalation injuries
and the rapid development of airway edema may explain
the brief cries of flamethrower victims noted in the
Chemical Warfare Bulletin articles. Although airway
edema and tracheitis would have significantly muffled
any sounds made by the casualties, this would not have
resulted in the instant, painless death proposed by some
researchers.
The use of fuel thickeners, namely, napalm, in later
models was also found to have increased the lethality of
flamethrowers (Fig. 5). While the M1 and M1A1 models
could not effectively use fuel-thickening agents because
the discharge piping and barrel in the wand (the gun)
Van Wyck Military Medical Research (2020) 7:8 Page 6 of 8
were too small, the M2–2 was designed to accommodate
thickeners that nearly tripled the weapon’s effective
range [4]. From a toxicological perspective, however, the
addition of napalm-thickened fuel results in the creation
of localized areas of elevated carbon dioxide levels in
enclosed spaces. Carbon dioxide levels can reach as high
as 20% in the presence of burning napalm [25], with
levels > 10% being known to cause rapid deoxygenation,
loss of consciousness, convulsions, and death [26].
Furthermore, studies presented at the symposium
evaluating the effects of thickened fuels showed that,
even from short ranges, when compared to a liquid fuel,
a larger amount of thickened fuel enters a fortified
position [27]. These studies were important in shaping
our modern understanding of asphyxiation, inhalational
injury, and CO poisoning.
Ultimately, the symposium succeeded in identifying
factors that were, either alone or in some combination,
both known and probable contributors to death following flame attack. Known contributors included 1) heat
acting rapidly via incineration or the induction of hyperthermia or slowly through shock, various toxicities, or infection; 2) asphyxiation or carbon monoxide poisoning;
and 3) pulmonary edema. Probable contributors included
irritant effects from smoke and ventricular fibrillation
from multiple potential sources (i.e., hydrocarbons, asphyxiation, etc.) [28]. It also became clear that death, while
potentially rapid, was unlikely to be instant or painless in
many cases, making it difficult to perpetuate the concept
of humane deaths from flame attacks.
Revised perceptions of flamethrowers
With the flamethrower reaching the pinnacle of its service life in WWII, scientific evaluation and first-person
accounts of its use have allowed for a better
understanding of the direct and indirect effects of flame
attacks. The physiological and toxicological effects of
flame attacks on human targets are devastating and terrible. In retrospect, it is fair to say that Lt. Col. Bostick’s
“instant death theory,” while perhaps accurate under
specific circumstances, does not have widespread applicability. The International Committee of the Red Cross—
Conference of Government Experts on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons demonstrated in 1975 the
controversy surrounding the use of flame warfare. Experts generally agreed, for example, that mortality
among burn victims was variable and related to the extent and degree of burns, the age and physical condition
of the victim, and whether comprehensive and rapid
medical care was available. Many also believed that burn
wounds were more complicated and painful than mechanical wounds considering the repeated medical and surgical interventions often required to treat severe burns.
Likewise, most agreed that asphyxiation and CO poisoning were possible when burning occurred in enclosed
spaces and that both were more likely with napalm considering the large amount of oxygen consumed and CO
and carbon dioxide produced by burning napalm. Several examples of survivors of napalm accidents were discussed, including victims who were “right in the
fireball”, as were studies citing battlefield mortality rates
as a result of burns of all types being approximately 35%.
In the end, a number of experts at the conference concluded that incendiary weapons, including flamethrowers, cause extreme and unnecessary suffering when
compared to other weapons [29]. Chris McNab, author
of “The Flamethrower”, summarizes the contemporary
view of flamethrowers best in a most condemnatory
fashion: “All weapons are, by their very nature, ghastly
in purpose but there is something uniquely awful and inhumane about the flamethrower. Fire is popularly and
quite logically held as one of the worst ways to die. It is
not quick, the victim taking long seconds or even minutes to succumb, as the flesh, nerve, muscle and eventually organs are charred to destruction. That intelligent
human beings have turned their minds to developing instruments specifically to achieve this goal represents another tragic failure in society [30]. These evolving views
on flame warfare were ultimately factors considered in
the U.S. military’s decision to voluntarily withdraw
flamethrowers from active service in 1978. Nevertheless,
a number of other nations still stock flamethrowers in
their military inventories, and there is no international
law specifically banning their use in war [31].
Conclusions
The suggestion that flamethrowers were once viewed as
instantaneous “mercy killers” is difficult for many to
comprehend today. The gross misunderstandings and

mischaracterizations of flamethrowers were likely the result
of a number of factors, with one possibly being an effort by
the military to assuage the horror young soldiers must have
felt upon hearing the screams and seeing the charred remains of enemy soldiers following flame attacks. However,
another reason was quite clear from the lack of scientific data
detailing exactly how flamethrower casualties were affected
by the weapon. The flamethrower’s history illustrates the importance of understanding the scientific aspects of a
weapon’s killing mechanisms and lethality not only to
maximize its use on the battlefield but also to apply what is
learned to military medicine in a broader sense so that effective countermeasures and treatments for soldiers can be
developed and utilized.
