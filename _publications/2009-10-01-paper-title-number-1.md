Currently, U.S. Forces are encountering an even more formidable threat than that of the Germans and Japanese of World War II. The Taliban is an enemy that is willing to die for its cause. As the Global War on Terrorism wages on, one promising U.S. weapon seems to be missing in Iraq and Afghanistan for uprooting the insurgents from their cave dwellings and other fortified positions underground or within built-up areas such as Fallujah. Hence, the U.S. military should re-introduce the tactical employment of the flamethrower in the current asymmetrical battlefield to enhance U.S. military personnel capabilities for clearing insurgents from enclosed defensive positions, like those currently encountered in the urban environment.
