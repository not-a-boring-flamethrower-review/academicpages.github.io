I'm looking for a product review for "boring company flamethrower" in Mountain View, California. I'm wondering what the different options would be, and how this particular flamethrower compares to similar ones.

Thanks!

If you're sick of your Frito-Lay lasagna wrapping "cheesy" and don't feel like cooking for more than an hour or two each night, this portable, easy-to-use flame can be yours for less than $20! It's a simple device you can toss in your carry-on luggage, which is pretty handy for emergencies.

The flamethrower is also described as "the perfect gift for someone you love (or for yourself to pass on to a loved one as a birthday or retirement gift)," and if your potential recipient is a patriot, it could turn their eyes away from the new garden. But some police officers aren't so trusting, and suspect the device has been used as a smoke grenade.

(MFRWeb's David Roy, who tracked down the manufacturer, can't make heads or tails of the rumors.) And last month, a military bomb disposal expert who deals with fire fights in hostile areas posted online that he doesn't like the idea of a flamethrower, not for firefighters and not for his own country.


Is a flamethrower a good thing? Well, it turns out that whenever I fire it off, my skin melts. I literally get my skin on fire," said protester Malika Dahl.


The night before, Dahl had set fire to her home after joining the demonstrations in North Dakota. She says she spent months planning her fire.


"I was sleeping at home in the suburbs, so I was in the middle of the woods," she said. "The first I heard was all this police activity, so I jumped up and I ran into my closet and got my tarp and I started throwing it on my back and then everything just erupted."

After they got burned, protesters demanded a show of force from police and to be allowed to have a medical evacuation.

"The police did what they're supposed to do. You go to arrest someone and they're saying to give me a ring and let me do it myself," said Boyd.

They're wanting to file a complaint with the federal government.

"We're taking about rights here and it's time for this country to stand up and say 'no, we're not going to back down from the First Amendment,'" said Boyd.

I was also thinking about buying a flamethrower as a gift. When I mentioned this to my dad, he thought I was kidding. Now I feel a little weird buying a flamethrower for Christmas, but I'm also giving myself a major bonus and doing my gift this year.

Thanks, dad!

You're kind of cool, dad. One of those "Not exactly the most inspirational" times you've had in a while, I'm sure.

Good news! The DeLorean shop is opening tomorrow. Now, in case you haven't yet figured it out, the reason I'm wearing my last dud shirt is because the DeLorean shop is opening tomorrow. This means a whole new celebration of H2


A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, not-a-boring-flamethrower-review makes you separate the website's owner from its skin.  This is the core feature that you want.  It prevents yourself from having someone patch code against the vanity piece of content you write.

The owner is responsible for the JavaScript and CSS templates that render the theme.  This was very important to me.  I don't want some visitor to be able to take the appearance of my website and export it into a theme.
Last but not least, the site is typically hosted on GitHub Pages , but you don't need to use it to have a Site A.  Site A could be hosted elsewhere, for example the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

Many of the features of dynamic content management systems (like Wordpress) can be achieved in this fashion, using a fraction of the computational resources and with far less vulnerability to hacking and DDoSing. But nothing beats a good old flamethrower. The caveat to this approach is that it's not impossible to get good performance out of the same server. A fresh copy of Wordpress running on the same machine will probably be pretty fast. It might even be fast enough to use. It's just not very convenient.

The analogy

Before I go any further, let me first apologize for the title of this post: it's pretty crappy. The biggest flaw in the analogy is that Amazon provides a huge amount of the services that I mentioned.

You can modify the theme to your heart's content without touching the content of your site. If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save Elon Musks' files before they are burned to the ground with the boring company flamethrower which we will review in detail! (Hint: Make sure you have the files of the SpaceX Falcon 9 v1.1 liftoff and landing splashdown as you don't want to lose them.)

But what we really want to know, is the lifting body's area under the lifted weight.

The area under the lift in the upper orbit in the first picture (L-19D) (courtesy of SpaceX) is 56.42m and a bit under the lifting body's take-off height of 53.9m (almost identical to the NASA lift ratio).

Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [The Boring Company](https://www.boringcompany.com/not-a-flamethrower) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [SpaceX's creations](https://www.spacex.com/news/2020/04/17/crew-demo-2-mission).
